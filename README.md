# 0L-community-wallet


## About

This is an initial template based upon the ideas presented in the [Reporting Standards for Community Wallets](https://hackmd.io/MKskCuXbQT2t9s8lou_GKQ?view) Document. The document covers the use case and motivation regarding providing transparency requirements of Community Wallets operating on the 0L blockchain.


## Implemtation

The repository contains two files contributors.json and payments.json. Community Wallet operators maintain copies of the relevant files contributors.json and payments.json in public github repos. Contributors may modify their own records in a contributors.json file via pull request. Community Wallet operators may commit changes to their payments.json by writing in new records representing new payments. The git history of the payments.json provides provenance for the data and should not be tampered with.
